# Turbulent Dynamics Coding Guidlines
This document gives some guidelines to contributing code to Turbulent Dynamics.

[View this on turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/)

### Some Visualisations
 * [Vector Identifiers](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/graphics/arrows.html) The vectors are numbered differently than usual LBM implementations
 * [Item Identifiers](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/graphics/cube.html) The cells in the outer shell of the lattice grid has been given an itentification
 * [Visualisation 1000 cubes](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/graphics/1000.html) 


### Utilities 
 * [Size Calculator](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/tools/calc-sizes.html) for setting dimensions of the lattice.
