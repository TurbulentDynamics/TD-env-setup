# Turbulent Dynamics
This document gives some guidelines to contributing code to Turbulent Dynamics.

[View this on turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/](https://turbulentdynamics.github.io/dev-help/)

### Some Visualisations
 * [Vector Identifiers](graphics/arrows.html) The vectors are numbered differently than usual LBM implementations
 * [Item Identifiers](graphics/cube.html) The cells in the outer shell of the lattice grid has been given an itentification
 * [Visualisation 1000 cubes](graphics/1000.html) 


### Utilities 
 * [Size Calculator](tools/calc-sizes.html) for setting dimensions of the lattice.
