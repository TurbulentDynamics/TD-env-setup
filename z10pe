#z10pe-D16 Motherboard

The Z10pe and nVidia cards do not play well together.  An error TSC_Timer prevents the nvidia driver from loading, (Sometimes this can prevent even the BMC loading at Boot time).  Normally using teh latest Bios AND Firmware at last allows booting into Runlevel 3 and monitor on VGA.  Normally the desktop can be started from runlevel 3 with sudo.
```
systemctl start .graphical



#Update BIOS
Download BIOS, copy to USB drive.  Restart z10pe, press delete to get into BIOS.  Use right arrow to the menu with ezFlash.  Hit enter to run EzFlash, then this will bring up menu with contents of the USB and select the latest BIOS file.
